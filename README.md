# Odin-Project
Taking on the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home)

Just a bunch of project done by me from the Odin project; to get better at web development.

## Google Homepage Clone
 So this was a fun project just taking a bit of time to clone a google Homepage.
Though there are some things missing like the menu and notification. It wasn't a speed run so to say just wanted to take sometime to see if I could do it. Again while things are missing I'm happy with it for the most part.
